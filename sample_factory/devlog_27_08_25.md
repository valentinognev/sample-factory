# step 1
added vf & vr to observation space. training shown no special behavior change.
# step 2
added action penalty proportional to actions. got some noise reduction.
(!) tested with signed velocities rather than abs(velocities).
    results inconclusive
# step 3
added action history (size is parameter) 
added action history average to observation space
changed action penalty reward to deviation from average
looks promising.
